Abstraction in java
Abstract means something which is not clear or not complete.
We use abstraction to create methods which are incomplete meaning
they do not have a body. They only have method headers.
Why should we create abstracts methods?
1) When we know that every child will be overriding
a method we don't need to have a method body.
20 It acts as a template when we create a method as abstract every
child must provide body for that.
It is used to enforce methods on the child classes.
Interfaces:
Interface is something which is common in two systems. It is
like a contract that helps us know what type of methods should be present in a class
 for that class to be able to work with other class.
