Methods:
A block of code that performs a spesific action when called. In java methods can only exit inside a class.
if the method is instance method we need to create the object of the class to call
if method is static we use the name of the class method name
Benefit:
They allow us to reuse code.
There are 2 main types of methods
1) method with void n type
2) Methods with specific return times
create a method which will take an array of
instance as input and going to return the sum of all the numbers from the input array
How do we know when we should create a static variable
Whenever we want to store something that is universal(Constans) and it does
usually change we can safely go and create a static variable for that.Like vakue of PI value of Gravity
How do we know when we create static methods?
When our methods dont require instance fields create them as static
