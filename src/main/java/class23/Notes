LinkedList:

Set:
    Sets are very very similar to list but they do not allow duplicate elements.There are 3 sets
    1-HashSets:
    Upside: Its super fast
    Downside: They don't store the data in order.
    2- LinkedHashSet:
    Upside: It remembers the order
    Downside: Itis slower than HashSet.
    3-TreeSet:
    Upside: It keeps the data sorted always
    Downside: inserting new elements very slow.
