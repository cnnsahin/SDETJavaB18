Polymorphism:
 it"s a mechanism in java that allows the methods behav differently depending upon which
 object are using to call them.There are two types of polymorphism dynamic and static.
 Dynamic polymorphism is achieve through method overriding
 Static Polymorphism is achieved through method overloading.

 Why should we use Polymorphism
 it allows us to avoid code repetition. if we have to call multiple methods
 from multiple calasese and they are sibling classes.

 What do we need to apply Polymorphism.
 1) Inheritance
 2) Method overriding
 3) Type casting
 4) Loops
 5) Arrays

 Interface:
 Interfaces are like contracts which makes sure that every body is on the same page
 They achieve this through abstraction.
